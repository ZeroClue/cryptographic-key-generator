# Accessibility & Internationalization

## Overview
Comprehensive accessibility improvements and multi-language support including full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, screen reader support, keyboard navigation, high contrast modes, and internationalization for global users.

## Problem Statement
The current implementation lacks comprehensive accessibility features and multi-language support, limiting usability for users with disabilities and non-English speakers globally.

## Key Benefits
- **Universal Access**: Full compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
- **Screen Reader Support**: Complete compatibility with assistive technologies
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full functionality without mouse interaction
- **Multi-language Support**: Internationalization for global accessibility
- **Visual Accessibility**: High contrast modes and customizable UI elements

## Target Users
- Users with visual impairments relying on screen readers
- Users with motor disabilities requiring keyboard navigation
- Non-English speaking users globally
- Users with low vision requiring high contrast
- Organizations with accessibility compliance requirements

## Implementation Considerations
- **WCAG Compliance**: Full implementation of WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines
- **Screen Reader**: ARIA labels, landmarks, and semantic HTML
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab order, shortcuts, and focus management
- **Internationalization**: Unicode support and RTL language compatibility
- **Visual Accessibility**: High contrast themes and scalable UI elements

## User Stories
- As a blind user, I want screen reader support so I can use all cryptographic features
- As a user with motor disabilities, I want full keyboard navigation so I can operate the tool without a mouse
- As a non-English speaker, I want the interface in my language so I can understand the features
- As a user with low vision, I want high contrast mode so I can see the interface clearly

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across all features
- [ ] Complete screen reader compatibility with proper ARIA implementation
- [ ] Comprehensive keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- [ ] Multi-language support with proper text direction handling
- [ ] High contrast mode with customizable color schemes
- [ ] Scalable UI elements supporting up to 200% zoom

## Technical Notes
- **Accessibility Framework**: React ARIA components and semantic HTML
