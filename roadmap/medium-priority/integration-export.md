# Integration & Export

## Overview
Comprehensive integration capabilities with cloud storage services, code generation for various programming languages, configuration file exports for popular systems, and mobile-friendly QR code sharing.

## Problem Statement
Users need to integrate generated keys into various ecosystems and workflows. Current export options are limited and don't support modern cloud infrastructure, automation workflows, or mobile scenarios.

## Key Benefits
- **Cloud Integration**: Direct export to AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, and other cloud services
- **Code Generation**: Ready-to-use code snippets in multiple programming languages
- **Configuration Export**: Native format support for web servers, databases, and applications
- **Mobile Sharing**: QR code generation for easy mobile key transfer
- **Workflow Automation**: API-style exports for CI/CD and DevOps pipelines

## Target Users
- DevOps engineers managing cloud infrastructure
- Developers integrating keys into applications
- System administrators configuring servers
- Mobile users needing key transfer capabilities

## Implementation Considerations
- **Cloud APIs**: Integration with major cloud provider key management services
- **Code Templates**: Multi-language support (Python, JavaScript, Go, Java, C#)
- **Format Support**: Apache/Nginx configs, Docker secrets, Kubernetes secrets
- **QR Codes**: Optimized encoding for various key types and sizes
- **Security**: End-to-end encryption for cloud transfers

## User Stories
- As a DevOps engineer, I want to export keys directly to AWS KMS so I can integrate with my cloud infrastructure
- As a developer, I want to generate code snippets so I can quickly implement cryptographic operations
