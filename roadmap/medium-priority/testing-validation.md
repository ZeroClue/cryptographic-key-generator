# Testing & Validation

## Overview
Comprehensive testing framework including compatibility validation against popular cryptographic tools, performance benchmarking, key format validation, and cross-platform interoperability checks.

## Problem Statement
Users need confidence that generated keys will work with their existing tools and systems. Current lack of validation creates uncertainty about compatibility and performance characteristics.
