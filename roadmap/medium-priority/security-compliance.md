# Security & Compliance

## Overview
Comprehensive security assessment and compliance features including real-time security scoring, industry standard compliance modes, visual key strength indicators, and secure data deletion capabilities.

## Problem Statement
Users need assurance that their cryptographic practices meet security standards and compliance requirements. Current tools lack visibility into security posture and don't provide guidance for industry best practices.

## Key Benefits
- **Security Audit**: Real-time assessment of cryptographic security practices
- **Compliance Modes**: Pre-configured settings for NIST, FIPS, and CNSA compliance
- **Visual Security**: Intuitive indicators for key strength and security levels
- **Secure Cleanup**: Complete data sanitization for sensitive information
- **Best Practices**: Automated guidance for secure cryptographic operations

## Target Users
- Security professionals requiring compliance validation
- Organizations with regulatory requirements (government, healthcare, finance)
- Security auditors and compliance officers
- Users concerned about cryptographic best practices

## Implementation Considerations
- **Security Scoring**: Algorithm-based assessment of key parameters and practices
- **Compliance Frameworks**: NIST SP 800-57, FIPS 140-2, CNSA Suite standards
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded security levels with detailed explanations
- **Secure Deletion**: Memory wiping and data sanitization techniques
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive security event tracking

## User Stories
- As a security professional, I want to see a security score for my keys so I can ensure they meet industry standards
- As a government contractor, I want to use FIPS-compliant algorithms so I can meet regulatory requirements
- As a security auditor, I want to verify key strength visually so I can quickly assess security posture
- As a user, I want to securely delete sensitive data so I can prevent unauthorized access

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Real-time security scoring algorithm with detailed feedback
- [ ] NIST, FIPS, and CNSA compliance mode presets
- [ ] Visual key strength meters with explanatory tooltips
- [ ] Secure deletion functionality for all sensitive data
- [ ] Security audit log with exportable reports
- [ ] Compliance validation against industry standards

## Technical Notes
- **Security Engine**: Modular scoring system with configurable criteria
