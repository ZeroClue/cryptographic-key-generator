# Copy to Clipboard

## Overview
One-click copying functionality for keys, results, and other important information to improve user workflow efficiency and reduce manual errors in data transfer.

## Problem Statement
Users currently need to manually select and copy cryptographic keys and results, which can be error-prone and inefficient, especially with long key strings.

## Key Benefits
- **Efficiency**: One-click copying reduces time and effort
- **Accuracy**: Eliminates manual selection errors
- **User Experience**: Streamlined workflow for key management
- **Accessibility**: Better experience for users with motor difficulties
- **Professional Feel**: Modern UI interaction patterns

## Target Users
- All users copying keys and cryptographic results
- Developers integrating keys into applications
- Security professionals managing multiple keys
- Users with accessibility needs

## Implementation Considerations
- **Security**: Secure clipboard access with proper permissions
- **Feedback**: Visual confirmation when copy succeeds
- **Fallback**: Support for browsers without clipboard API
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard shortcuts and screen reader support
- **Multiple Formats**: Copy in different formats (PEM, Base64, Hex)

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to copy keys with one click so I can quickly use them in other applications
- As a developer, I want to copy results in different formats so I can integrate them easily
- As a user with motor difficulties, I want easy copying so I can avoid manual selection

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] One-click copy buttons for all keys and results
- [ ] Visual feedback showing successful copy operation
- [ ] Support for multiple output formats
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for copy operations
- [ ] Fallback for browsers without clipboard API
- [ ] Accessibility compliance with screen readers

## Technical Notes
- **Clipboard API**: Modern navigator.clipboard API with fallbacks

- **Format Options**: Context-aware format selection
- **Security**: Proper permission handling and cleanup

## Dependencies
- Clipboard API polyfills for older browsers
- Toast notification library or custom implementation
- Icon library for copy/clipboard icons

## Success Metrics

- User satisfaction with copy functionality
- Reduction in manual selection errors
- Time saved in key management workflows

## Integration Points
- KeyGenerator component for generated keys
- EncryptDecrypt component for results
- SignVerify component for signatures
- All export functionality areas

## Implementation Priority
**Quick Win** - Can be implemented in 1-2 days with immediate user benefit
