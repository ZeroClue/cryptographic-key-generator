# Loading States

## Overview
Improved loading indicators and progress feedback during cryptographic operations to provide users with clear visual feedback about operation status, progress, and expected completion times.

## Problem Statement
Users currently have limited feedback during long-running cryptographic operations, leading to uncertainty about whether the application is working or frozen, especially during key generation with large parameters.

## Key Benefits
- **User Confidence**: Clear feedback that operations are progressing
- **Professional Feel**: Modern loading states and progress indicators
- **Error Prevention**: Users less likely to abort working operations
- **Accessibility**: Better experience for users with cognitive disabilities
- **Performance Insight**: Users understand operation complexity

## Target Users
- All users performing cryptographic operations
- Users generating large keys or using complex algorithms
- Users with slower computers or browsers
- Anyone needing clear operation feedback

## Implementation Considerations
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual progress bars for multi-step operations
- **Loading Spinners**: Clear indication that work is in progress
- **Time Estimates**: Expected completion time when possible
- **Operation Status**: Clear descriptions of what's happening
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader announcements of progress

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to see progress during key generation so I know it's working
- As a user with a slow computer, I want loading indicators so I don't think the app is frozen
- As a user, I want time estimates so I know how long to wait
- As a user with accessibility needs, I want progress announcements so I understand what's happening

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Loading spinners for all cryptographic operations
- [ ] Progress bars for multi-step operations
- [ ] Time estimates for long-running operations
- [ ] Clear operation status descriptions
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility for progress updates
- [ ] Consistent loading state design across the application

## Technical Notes
- **Loading Components**: Reusable loading spinner and progress bar components
- **State Management**: Track operation progress and update UI accordingly
- **Time Estimation**: Algorithm-based time estimation for operations
- **Accessibility**: ARIA live regions for progress announcements

## Dependencies
- Loading spinner libraries or custom implementations
- Progress bar components
- State management for operation tracking
- Accessibility testing tools

## Success Metrics
- User satisfaction with loading feedback
- Reduction in user abandonment during operations
- Improved user confidence in application stability
- Accessibility compliance for loading states

## Integration Points
- All cryptographic operations in cryptoService.ts
- KeyGenerator component for key generation progress
- EncryptDecrypt component for encryption/decryption operations
- SignVerify component for signing/verification operations

## Loading State Types
- **Indeterminate**: Simple spinners for unknown duration operations
- **Determinate**: Progress bars for measurable operations
- **Step-based**: Multi-step progress for complex operations
- **Time-based**: Countdown timers for predictable operations
- **Status Messages**: Descriptive text about current operation

## Design Considerations
- **Consistency**: Uniform loading state design across the app
- **Performance**: Lightweight animations that don't impact operation speed
- **Clarity**: Clear visual indicators that are easy to understand
- **Accessibility**: High contrast and screen reader compatible
- **Responsiveness**: Works well on all screen sizes

## Implementation Priority
**Quick Win** - Can be implemented in 2-3 days with immediate UX improvement
