# Download History

## Overview
Export functionality for operation history allowing users to download their cryptographic activities in CSV or JSON format for record-keeping, auditing, and analysis purposes.

## Problem Statement
Users currently have no way to export their cryptographic operation history, making it difficult to maintain records, conduct audits, or analyze their cryptographic activities over time.

## Key Benefits
- **Record Keeping**: Persistent records of all cryptographic operations
- **Audit Trail**: Exportable history for compliance and auditing
- **Analysis**: Data analysis of cryptographic usage patterns
- **Backup**: Local backup of operation history
- **Professional Use**: Integration with external documentation systems

## Target Users
- Security professionals requiring audit trails
- Organizations with compliance requirements
- Users wanting to analyze their cryptographic usage
- Anyone needing persistent records of their activities

## Implementation Considerations
- **Data Format**: Support for CSV and JSON export formats
- **Filtering**: Allow users to filter history before export
- **Privacy**: Exclude sensitive key material from exports
- **Timestamps**: Include detailed timing information
- **Metadata**: Add operation types, algorithms, and parameters

## User Stories
- As a security professional, I want to export my operation history so I can maintain audit records
- As a compliance officer, I want to download activity logs so I can demonstrate compliance
- As a user, I want to analyze my cryptographic usage patterns so I can optimize my workflow

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Export operation history in CSV format
- [ ] Export operation history in JSON format
- [ ] Filter options for date ranges and operation types
- [ ] Exclude sensitive key material from exports
- [ ] Include metadata (timestamps, algorithms, parameters)
- [ ] User-friendly export interface with clear options

## Technical Notes
- **Data Processing**: Transform history data into exportable formats
- **File Generation**: Client-side file creation and download
- **Filtering UI**: Date range pickers and operation type filters
- **Privacy Controls**: Options to include/exclude sensitive data

## Dependencies
- File generation libraries
- Date picker components
- CSV/JSON formatting utilities
- History tracking system

## Success Metrics
- Export feature usage rates
- User satisfaction with export functionality
- Data accuracy in exported files
- Integration with external systems

## Integration Points
- History tracking system
- Settings and preferences
- Export functionality
- Data filtering components

## Export Data Structure
- **Timestamp**: Operation date and time
- **Operation Type**: Key generation, encryption, signing, etc.
- **Algorithm**: Specific algorithm used
- **Parameters**: Key size, curves, etc.
- **Success Status**: Operation success or failure
- **Duration**: Time taken for operation

## Implementation Priority
**Quick Win** - Can be implemented in 2-3 days with existing history data
