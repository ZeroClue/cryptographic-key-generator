# Developer Tools

## Overview
Comprehensive developer-focused tools including a command-line interface, browser extension for quick access, WebSocket API for real-time collaboration, and an extensible plugin system for custom algorithms.

## Problem Statement
Developers need programmatic access to cryptographic operations and integration with their existing development workflows. The current web-only interface limits automation and integration capabilities.

## Key Benefits
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line access for automation and scripting
- **Browser Extension**: Quick access and form filling integration
- **WebSocket API**: Real-time collaborative key generation
- **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for custom algorithms
- **Developer Experience**: Seamless integration with development workflows

## Target Users
- DevOps engineers automating cryptographic operations
- Software developers integrating cryptography into applications
- Security teams building custom cryptographic solutions
- Open-source contributors extending the platform

## Implementation Considerations
- **CLI Architecture**: Cross-platform command-line tool with Node.js
- **Browser Extension**: Chrome/Firefox extension with secure messaging
- **WebSocket Server**: Real-time collaboration with authentication
- **Plugin SDK**: Well-documented API for third-party extensions
- **API Design**: RESTful and WebSocket APIs with comprehensive documentation

## User Stories
- As a DevOps engineer, I want a CLI tool so I can automate key generation in my CI/CD pipelines
- As a developer, I want a browser extension so I can quickly generate keys without leaving my workflow
- As a team lead, I want real-time collaboration so my team can conduct key ceremonies together
- As a cryptographer, I want to develop custom plugins so I can implement new algorithms

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Cross-platform CLI tool with full feature parity
- [ ] Browser extension with secure key generation and form filling
- [ ] WebSocket API for real-time collaborative operations
- [ ] Plugin SDK with documentation and examples
- [ ] Comprehensive API documentation and SDKs
- [ ] Integration with popular development tools

## Technical Notes
- **CLI Framework**: Commander.js or similar for cross-platform CLI
- **Browser Extension**: Manifest V3 with secure messaging protocols
- **WebSocket Server**: Socket.io or WebSocket with authentication
- **Plugin Architecture**: Sandaled plugin system with API boundaries
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger specs and interactive docs

## Dependencies
