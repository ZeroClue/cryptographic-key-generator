# Key Management & Storage

## Overview
A comprehensive key management system that provides secure local storage, audit trails, backup capabilities, and automated key lifecycle management for all generated cryptographic keys.

## Problem Statement
Currently, generated keys exist only in browser memory and are lost when the session ends. Users need a secure way to store, organize, and manage their cryptographic keys over time with proper security controls.

## Key Benefits
- **Persistent Storage**: Secure local storage of keys across browser sessions
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of key generation and usage
- **Backup & Recovery**: Encrypted backup for key migration between devices
- **Automated Lifecycle**: Key expiration alerts and rotation reminders
- **Enhanced Security**: Master password protection and secure deletion

## Target Users
- Security professionals managing multiple key pairs
- Developers working with various cryptographic algorithms
- Organizations requiring key audit trails
- Users needing long-term key storage solutions

## Implementation Considerations
- **Storage Technology**: IndexedDB with encryption layers
- **Security Model**: Master password derivation using PBKDF2/Argon2
- **Backup Format**: Encrypted JSON with version compatibility
- **Memory Management**: Secure cleanup of sensitive data
- **Browser Compatibility**: Support for modern browsers with crypto APIs

## User Stories
- As a security professional, I want to store my generated keys securely so I can reuse them across sessions
- As a developer, I want to see the history of all keys I've generated so I can track their usage
- As an organization, I want to backup my keys securely so I can recover them if needed
- As a user, I want to be alerted when my keys expire so I can rotate them on time

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Keys can be stored securely with master password protection
- [ ] Complete audit trail shows generation time, algorithm, and usage
- [ ] Encrypted backup files can be created and restored
- [ ] Key expiration alerts are displayed with rotation suggestions
- [ ] Secure deletion removes all traces of keys from memory
- [ ] Import/export functionality supports key migration

## Technical Notes
- **Architecture**: Service-based key management with encrypted storage
- **Integration Points**: KeyGenerator, EncryptDecrypt, SignVerify components
- **Performance**: Efficient indexing and search capabilities
- **Security**: Zero-knowledge architecture with client-side encryption only

## Dependencies
- IndexedDB API for local storage
- Web Crypto API for encryption operations
- Password strength library (zxcvbn)
- Date/time utilities for expiration tracking

## Success Metrics
- Number of keys successfully stored and retrieved
- User adoption of backup/restore features
- Key rotation compliance rate
- Security audit completion rate

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Data Loss**: Implement robust backup and recovery mechanisms
- **Security Breach**: Use strong encryption and secure key derivation
- **Browser Compatibility**: Provide fallbacks for older browsers
- **Performance**: Optimize for large key collections

## Future Enhancements
- Cloud storage integration with end-to-end encryption
- Multi-device synchronization
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities
- Key usage analytics and reporting
